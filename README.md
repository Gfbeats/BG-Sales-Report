# INTRODUCTION

If a company wants to consistently see increases in sales, it must periodically review its sales report to identify its advantages and disadvantages. This project's main goal was to assess sales performance, profitability, and average sales across the entire selling region within a specified time frame using its principal components.

The following commercial inquiries also provided some understanding.

• Which shopping city has the highest sales volume?

• What was the total amount of revenue generated?

• Which chain has the best sales performance?

• How much was sold overall in each territory, and which territory led the way in sales?

• Which region has the most area for sales?

• In total, how many transactions have occurred?

• What is the maximum sale for the company?

# DATA COLLETION

As a capstone project, the dataset used in this work was obtained from @study.utiva.io.

This dataset spans a brief period of time and contains more than 100 transactions in the sales table. The knowledge gained from this research will successfully optimize sales performance across all BG stores.

The dataset had three tables in XLSX format.

• IDShop, name, chain, territory, competitive territory, sales, selling area, annual sales, annual and sales per selling area were all included in the sales table.

• The columns for territory and competitive territory were present in the territory table.

• The territory, city, and shopId were listed on the store table.

# TOOL USED

In this Project,I utilized PowerBI for visualization.

# DATA PREPARATION 

The following steps were done in order to get the data ready for analysis.

• To import the three xlsx datasets, PowerBi was utilized. 

• I performed an ETL procedure and used Power Query Editor to transform the data before loading it for analysis and visualization. 

• I began the process of cleaning the data by first checking the three tables for duplicate values, but none were discovered.

 •  I checked my tables to make sure there were no null finds. 

• In addition, I made sure that each column was represented by the proper data type.

# FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
